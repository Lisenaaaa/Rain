## A ~~small~~ pretty big update
I've fully cancelled development on this, at least until my mental health is way better than it is now, and until I actually have a reason to keep working on it. Due to several personal incidents that I'd rather not go in detail about, I've fully left the Hypixel community, which is something I've been meaning to do for a long time. It also means, however, that I have left SkyClien't, the Discord server that I was originally making this for.

If I ever find both motivation and a reason to keep making this (such as a community I end up with a high enough position in to make a bot for), I will do it. 

Here's all the unfinished code.

~~This originally started as a small project for me to learn Java with, and I believe I was going to use it for a smallish server.~~

~~After a week or so, people convinced me to switch to Typescript, with `discord.js` and `discord-akairo`. It was not like anything I had ever done before, but I was also really new to programming in general.~~

~~I succesfully made a (shitty) bot, which I've since rewritten a few times, over at https://github.com/Lisenaaaa/Rain-TEMP. The code is old, and I think it's horrible compared to what I've been doing lately.~~

~~I was using a fork of discord.js and akairo for a while, both of them made by a person who's usual method of helping me fix problems with them was "it works on my machine".~~

~~So now this exists, using base discord.js and Sapphire! Currently my goals with it are to replace [Fire](https://github.com/FireDiscordBot/bot) (at least moderation, ofc not all it's random stuff), which is fine at best, for a number of reasons. It's permission system is awful, and... you should just see what the developer does when someone uses the bot's PFP.~~

~~Other than those two fairly big problems with it, it's a great bot. But those make it suck for me, at least. If there is a bot out there with good permissions, I've never heard of it, but good for you for making a bot with basic moderation bot features that don't suck.~~
